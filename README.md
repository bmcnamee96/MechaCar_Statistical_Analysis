# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![linear_regression](https://github.com/bmcnamee96/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Screenshots/linear_regression.png)

- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
  - All of the variables provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values.
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
  - No the slope is shown in the intercept estimate row of the results
- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
  - No it does not. It needs to take into account all of the variables as one not individually

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

![total_summary](https://github.com/bmcnamee96/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Screenshots/total_summary.png)

- The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
  - No the current manufacturing data does not meet this specifications.  The mean for all the variables is 1498.78 pounds per square inch.  This is no where near the requireded specifications.
