  - All of the variables provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values.
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
  - No the slope is shown in the intercept estimate row of the results
- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
  - No it does not. It needs to take into account all of the variables as one not individually
